    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team1 = players;
    console.log(team1, players);

    //team1[3] = 'Johnny';
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'John Lee',
      age: 27
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap1 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100});

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //const cap2 = {...person};

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const john = {
      name: 'john',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@john',
        facebook:'john'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev2  = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(john));
