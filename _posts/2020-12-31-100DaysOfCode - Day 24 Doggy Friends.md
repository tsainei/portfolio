I watch the videos of The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery and make this React app step by step. I decide to make it a doggy friends app instead of robofriends, since dogs are cuter.

I find out React is not as hard as I thought last year. I get to learn a bit more and more and I gain more confidence now. I will work on with a flashcard React app right after.

This is the end of the year, wish all of you happy new year! 

This year has been tough for me. I was trapped in a motorhome from March to May, and then I'm trapped at home since October till now. Also, I lost my job. I haven't seen any friends and my own family for almost a year. Everyday it annoys me so much to see people not obeying the rule and spreading the virus. It pains more to hear my hubby's relative was taken away by this virus. 

I truly hope next year would be better and everyone healthy.
