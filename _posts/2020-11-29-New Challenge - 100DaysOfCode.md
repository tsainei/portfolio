After finishing Javascript30, I'd like to challenge myself with more projects. Therefore, I'll start with [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). I will start today!

In this 100 day challenge, I'll do a small project everyday based on [100+ JavaScript Projects for Beginners!](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)

After I finish a project, I'll write a blog to show my thoughts and codes.

In order to balance my coding life and health, I'll also start [100DaysOfHealth](https://www.100daysofx.com/where-x-is/health/). I'll do back stretch and exercise everyday to relieve my back pain.

I'm so excited to start this project. Wish me luck!
