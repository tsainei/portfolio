I follow [Simple Image Lightbox Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKVVSwXdLr0) to make this project. 

I get to learn to grid and [Animate.css](https://animate.style/).

> This is my project: [Day19_lightbox](https://portfolio.tsainei.com/100DaysOfCode/Day19_lightbox/) and my [code](https://github.com/tsainei/portfolio/tree/main/100DaysOfCode/Day19_lightbox)
