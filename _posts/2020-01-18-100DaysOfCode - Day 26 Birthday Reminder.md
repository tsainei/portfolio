I maKe this project by following John Smilga's amazing video [Full React Course 2020 - Learn Fundamentals, Hooks, Context API, React Router, Custom Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4) Along with the projects he instructs in the video, I can learn React hooks with ease.

> This is my project: [Day26_birthday_reminder](https://portfolio.tsainei.com/100DaysOfCode/Day26_birthday_reminder/) and my [code](https://github.com/tsainei/portfolio/tree/main/100DaysOfCode/Day26_birthday_reminder)

I use a React hook `useState` to make this birthday reminder.

## What are React hooks?

React hooks are functions we use in our function components. With hooks, we don't need to bother with class! yay!

## useState

`useState` lets us use state in our components.

## What is state?

The state object is where we store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
