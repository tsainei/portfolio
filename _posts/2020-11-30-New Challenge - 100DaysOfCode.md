After finishing Javascript30, I'd like to challenge myself with more. Therefore, I'd like to challenge [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). I will start today!

In this 100 day challenge, I'll do a small project everyday based on [100+ JavaScript Projects for Beginners!](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)

After I finish a project, I'll write a blog to show my thoughts and codes.

I'm so excited to start this project. Wish me luck!
