After finishing Javascript30, I'd like to challenge myself with more. Therefore, I'd like to challenge 100DaysOfCode. I will start today!

In this 100 day challenge, I will do a small project everyday based on (100+ JavaScript Projects for Beginners!)[https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/]

After I finish a project, I will write a blog to show my thoughts and codes.

I'm so excited to start this project. Wish me luck!
